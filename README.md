# Auth Page

Polished, two-panel sign-in screen inspired by the JSMastery design. Includes a security-focused marketing panel, modern gradient/glass styling, inline validation feedback, and social sign-in buttons (Google, GitHub).

## Structure
- `index.html` — main page layout and content.
- `assets/styles/main.css` — styling, theming, and responsive rules.
- `assets/scripts/main.js` — password toggle and lightweight validation UX.

## Running locally
Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or serve the folder if you prefer a local server:
```bash
npx serve .
```

## Customization
- Update copy and highlights in `index.html` to match your product.
- Tweak colors/spacing in `assets/styles/main.css` (CSS variables at the top).
- Extend validation or integrate real auth flows in `assets/scripts/main.js`.
